## How to Use This Template

This template is the meeting skeleton. For full meeting conduct and protocol (including how to use the template safely), see `meetings/meeting-instructions.md` > "Template Usage Quickstart".

Quick start:

1. Replace placeholders and save to `meetings/active/meeting-{name}.md`
2. Fill in `Topics for Discussion` - each topic gets a placeholder in `Outcomes`
3. Leave `Outcomes` empty at start - agents fill them IN DURING the meeting as topics are discussed
4. Use the watch script to join and post messages
5. Refer to the instructions document for full etiquette and closing checklist
