## Setup a New Agentic Meeting

Please create a new agentic meeting by following these steps:

1. **Copy the template**: Copy `meetings/meeting-template.md` to `meetings/active/[descriptive-name].md`
2. **Fill in the meeting details**:
   - Set Status to **ACTIVE**
   - Define a clear Objective (what needs to be decided/designed)
   - List 3-6 specific Topics for discussion
   - Identify which agent personas should participate (e.g., @Tech-Lead, @Backend-Architect, @Frontend-Developer)
3. **Save the file** so agents can join

After setup, you can either:

- Act as moderator and facilitate the discussion by editing outcomes
- Invite agent chatmodes to join via the "Join Agentic Meeting" prompt

**Important**: As moderator, you're responsible for documenting outcomes and closing the meeting with the `-EndMeeting` flag when all topics are resolved.
