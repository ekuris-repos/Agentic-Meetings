## 🚀 How to Use

### Understanding Agentic Meetings

An **Agentic Meeting** is a structured collaboration session where multiple AI agent personas work together to solve problems, design systems, or make decisions. Unlike traditional meetings:

- **No scheduling required** - Agents participate asynchronously through file-based coordination
- **Structured outcomes** - Each meeting produces documented decisions, action plans, and reasoning chains
- **Role-based participation** - Each agent brings domain expertise (backend, frontend, DevOps, product strategy, etc.)
- **Protocol-driven** - Agents follow standardized instructions for joining, monitoring, responding, and completing meetings
- **Auditable transcripts** - Complete record of all agent contributions with timestamps and reasoning

## 🎬 Quick Start with Prompts

This repository includes built-in prompts accessible via the `/prompt` command in GitHub Copilot Chat to streamline common workflows:

### Available Prompts

| Prompt Command | Purpose | Who Uses It |
|----------------|---------|-------------|
| `/prompt setup-meeting` | Create a new agentic meeting from template | Moderators, Meeting initiators |
| `/prompt join-meeting` | Join an active meeting as an agent persona | All agent chatmodes |
| `/prompt moderate-meeting` | Facilitate and close meetings | Moderators only |
| `/prompt respond-meeting` | Post responses during active discussions | All participating agents |
| `/prompt review-protocol` | Quick reference for protocol rules | Everyone |

### How to Use Prompts

1. **Open GitHub Copilot Chat** in VS Code
2. **Type `/prompt`** and you'll see the available prompts
3. **Select the prompt** you need for your current task
4. **Follow the instructions** provided by the prompt

### Example Workflow

**Setting up a new meeting:**

``` text
You: /prompt setup-meeting
[Follow the prompt instructions to create meetings/active/api-redesign.md]
```

**Inviting an agent to join:**

``` text
You (to Backend-Architect Personna): /prompt join-meeting
Agent: [Reads meeting, posts joining message, begins monitoring loop]
```

**Moderating the discussion:**

``` text
You: /prompt moderate-meeting
[Use guidance to document outcomes and close when complete]
```

Simply type `/prompt` in Copilot Chat and select the workflow you need!

### Starting a Meeting

1. **Create a meeting file**: Copy `meetings/meeting-template.md` to `meetings/active/your-topic.md`
2. **Set status to ACTIVE**: Ensure `Status: ACTIVE` in the header
3. **Define your objective and topics**: Fill in what needs to be discussed and decided
4. **Invite agents**: Open chatmode panels for the agents you want to include (e.g., @Tech-Lead, @Backend-Architect, @Frontend-Developer)
5. **Agents join via protocol**: Each agent reads the meeting file and runs the watch script to begin participating

### Inviting Agents

1. **Open a chatmode**: Use Ctrl+Shift+P → "Chat: Focus on Chat View"
2. **Select an agent persona**: Choose from available chatmodes (e.g., @Tech-Lead, @Product-Manager, @DevOps-Engineer)
3. **Instruct the agent to join**: Tell the agent: "Please join the meeting in meetings/active/your-topic.md"
4. **Agent follows protocol**: The agent will read the meeting file, post a joining message, and begin monitoring via `watch-meeting.ps1`

### Meeting Protocol

**For Agents (detailed protocol in `meetings/meeting-instructions.md`):**

1. Read the meeting file to understand Status, Objective, Topics, and current Transcript
2. Join by posting a message via the watch script: `.\scripts\watch-meeting.ps1 -Persona "Your-Persona" -MeetingFile "meetings/active/file.md" -Message "Joining discussion"`
3. Script automatically enters monitoring mode and waits for file changes
4. When file changes are detected, script exits and shows recent messages
5. Check Status field:
   - If Status is **ACTIVE** → Evaluate if you should respond, then post via script with `-Message` parameter
   - If Status is **COMPLETE** → Exit meeting, do not restart monitoring
6. After posting a response, script automatically returns to monitoring mode
7. **Loop continues until Status: COMPLETE** (this is mandatory - agents must keep monitoring)

**For Moderators (detailed workflow in `meetings/moderator-instructions.md`):**

- Create meeting file from template with clear Objective and Topics
- Monitor agent participation in the Transcript section
- Document consensus and decisions in the Outcomes section
- Address specific agents with `@Agent-Name` when needed
- Use the watch script with `-EndMeeting` flag to change Status to **COMPLETE** when all topics are resolved

### Ending a Meeting

The moderator closes the meeting using the watch script's `-EndMeeting` flag:

**PowerShell:**

```powershell
.\meetings\scripts\Powershell\watch-meeting.ps1 -Persona "Moderator-Name" -MeetingFile "meetings/active/file.md" -EndMeeting
```

**Python:**

```bash
python meetings/scripts/python/watch-meeting.py --persona "Moderator-Name" --file "meetings/active/file.md" --end-meeting
```

This changes the Status field to **COMPLETE**, which all monitoring agents will detect and exit their loops.

## 🔄 Expected Flow

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
start
:Moderator updates meeting file;
:PowerShell detects file change and exits;
:Agent reads meeting content;
:Agent checks Status field;
if (Status == ACTIVE?) then (yes)
     :Responds and loops back to monitoring;
     -[#green]-> PowerShell detects file change and exits;
else (no)
     :Exits meeting;
     stop
endif

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Script Versions

This repository provides two equivalent implementations of the `watch-meeting` script:

1. **PowerShell** (`meetings/scripts/Powershell/watch-meeting.ps1`) - Native Windows/PowerShell Core support for Linux/macOS
2. **Python** (`meetings/scripts/python/watch-meeting.py`) - Pure Python 3.7+ with zero dependencies, completely cross-platform

Both versions provide identical functionality. See the README files in their respective directories for detailed usage instructions.

### PowerShell Script Features

- **File Monitoring**: Uses file system timestamps to detect changes
- **Timeout Protection**: 5-minute timeout prevents infinite waiting
- **Error Handling**: Validates file existence and handles read errors
- **Agent Identification**: `-Persona` parameter for clear logging and message attribution
- **Message Posting**: `-Message` parameter appends timestamped messages to transcript
- **Meeting Control**: `-EndMeeting` flag for moderators to close meetings
- **Automatic Monitoring**: After posting messages, script automatically enters monitoring mode
- **Clean Exit**: Exits with code 0 to properly signal agents

### Agent Protocol Details

- **Loop Behavior**: Agents MUST continue monitoring loop until Status: COMPLETE
- **Message Format**: Automatically timestamped as `**[Persona - YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]:** Message`
- **Addressing**: Use `@Agent-Name` to direct messages to specific agents  
- **Status Checking**: Agents must check Status field after each file change to determine continue/exit
- **No Direct Editing**: Agents never directly edit meeting files - all communication via watch script
- **Read Anytime**: Agents can read meeting files for context, but write only through the script

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Responding

- Verify the meeting file path is correct in your watch script command
- Check agent is running the watch script with correct `-Persona` parameter matching their chatmode name
- Ensure meeting file Status is set to **ACTIVE** (agents exit when Status is COMPLETE)
- Confirm file changes are being saved (file modifications trigger monitoring script exit)

### Script Errors

- Confirm PowerShell execution policy allows script running: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
- Verify paths are correct relative to workspace root
- Check file permissions for the meeting file in `meetings/active/`
- Ensure the meeting file exists before agents try to join

### Meeting Stuck

- Moderator can force close with: `.\scripts\watch-meeting.ps1 -Persona "Moderator" -MeetingFile "path" -EndMeeting`
- Check if agents are still in monitoring loops (look for running PowerShell terminals)
- Verify all topics have documented outcomes before closing
- Review transcript to ensure all agents have had opportunity to contribute
